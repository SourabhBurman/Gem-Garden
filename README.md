<h3>React.js:</h3>
Our frontend is built using React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for constructing user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows us to create modular and reusable UI components, fostering an efficient and maintainable development process.

<h3>Chakra UI:</h3>
Chakra UI is seamlessly integrated into our project, enhancing the styling and design aspects of our website. This component library for React empowers us to build beautiful and responsive user interfaces with minimal effort, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent user experience.

<h3>JavaScript (JS):</h3>
JavaScript serves as the backbone of our frontend development, enabling dynamic and interactive features on our website. It plays a crucial role in providing a seamless and engaging user experience.

<h1>Backend Technology</h1>
<h2>RESTful API</h2>
Our backend relies on a RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) to handle data requests and interactions with the database. This API follows REST principles, providing a standardized and scalable approach to building web services. It enables communication between the frontend and backend, allowing users to browse products, manage accounts, view their cart, and place orders seamlessly.
